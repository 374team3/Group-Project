How to read our code:
---------------------

Our code is written in two different languages. Why?
--> Arduino uses the C/C++ dialect (not exactly C/C++, but very close).
--> Raspberry PI, on the other hand, uses Python as its standard language.
--> Code files ending in .ino, .c, or .cpp are written in C/C++, and files ending in .py are written in Python


The process:
-------------

--> All of our LED's and switches are hardcoded in Arduino C++
--> They are interfaced with Raspberry's python files to set up the general purpose inputs & outputs
--> The Raspberry PI uses its sound channels to then play sounds (output) corresponding to the inputs
--> coming from the Arduino (buttons & switches)

Additional features:
--------------------

--> We have implemented a panel with Potentiometers (variable resistors) and LED's.
--> There are three LED's next to each potentiometer. As the knob is turned, gradually all 3 LED's will turn on.
